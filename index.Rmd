Hello! I am an all-but-internship doctoral candidate in the [clinical psychological science PhD program](https://psychology.arizona.edu/clinical) at the University of Arizona. I am completing my clinical internship/residency year at the [VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System](https://www.va.gov/pittsburgh-health-care). **I am currently looking for a postdoctoral research position to start around August 2021**.

I work in Dr. Mary-Frances O'Connor's _[Grief, Loss, and Social Stress (GLASS) Lab](https://mfoconnor.faculty.arizona.edu)_, where I use fMRI and other methods to study how the death of a close loved one impacts the brain and how adaptation to the loss is reflected in brain network functioning, in order to better understand why some people develop [complicated grief](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/complicated-grief/symptoms-causes/syc-20360374) (or the ICD-11's "prolonged grief disorder") while others are able to cope more effectively. 

I am particularly interested in the role of internal thought in bereavement adaptation, as complicated grief is marked by persistent, acute yearning for the deceased and/or preoccupying rumination about their death. Like other perseverative thought processes (such as worry), yearning and grief-related rumination are something that nearly all bereaved people experience to some degree. However, in complicated grief, these are often very intense, painful, and distressing symptoms that last for a long time, and likely play a significant role in preventing the person from adjusting to their new reality of life without their loved one. I am also interested in how processes like social cognition and reward learning may contribute to a person's risk for developing complicated grief or other psychopathology.
