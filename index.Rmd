Hello! I am currently a T32 postdoctoral research fellow in Psychiatry at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. </p>

While earning my PhD in clinical psychology at the University of Arizona, I worked in Dr. Mary-Frances O'Connor's [Grief, Loss, and Social Stress (GLASS) Lab](https://mfoconnor.faculty.arizona.edu). I used fMRI and other methods to study how the death of a close loved one impacts the brain and how adaptation to the loss is reflected in brain network functioning, in order to better understand why some people develop [complicated grief](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/complicated-grief/symptoms-causes/syc-20360374) (or the ICD-11's "prolonged grief disorder") while others are able to cope more effectively. 

I am particularly interested in the role of internal thought in bereavement adaptation, as complicated grief is marked by persistent, acute yearning for the deceased and/or preoccupying rumination about their death. Like other perseverative thought processes (such as worry), yearning and grief-related rumination are something that nearly all bereaved people experience to some degree. However, in complicated grief, these are often very intense, painful, and distressing symptoms that last for a long time, and likely play a significant role in preventing the person from adjusting to their new reality of life without their loved one. I am also interested in how processes like emotion regulation, social cognition, and reward learning may contribute to a person's risk for developing complicated grief or other psychopathology such as PTSD.
