Hello! I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow in the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai's Psychiatry Department.</p>

I completed my PhD in clinical psychology at the University of Arizona and the Pittsburgh VA Medical Center, following undergraduate studies at CUNY Hunter College. My research at ISMMS aims to identify neural mechanisms of adaptation to trauma and loss, with a current focus on (1) PTSD resilience in a cohort of 9/11 WTC responders (in the [World Trade Center Mental Health Program](https://www.mountsinai.org/care/occupational-health/services-programs/wtc)), and (2) developing a computational model of prolonged grief disorder (in the [Affective Neuroscience Lab](https://labs.neuroscience.mssm.edu/project/schiller-lab/)).
